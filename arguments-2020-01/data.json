                        "explanation": "There are two main parts to the claim: A: The reviewer suggests that characters in the film are somewhat racist B: The racist characters are main characters  The first quote in the direct evidence isn't evidence for either part of the claim: \"I've been cursed by a black magician\" is certainly a plausible thing for a racist to say, but doesn't establish that the reviewer suggests the character is racist. The second quote is fairly strong evidence for A, *if* the \"preconceptions\" are racial. The first quote provides very weak evidence that the preconceptions are racist, but overall the direct evidence is consistent with many interpretations other than the one stated in the claim. There is no evidence given that Anna and Tyler are main characters.   I don't understand what message the rebuttal is trying to convey. My best guess is that the rebuttal is attempting to establish that Payne is a main character, in order to imply that Anna and Tyler are *not* main characters? OTOH,  mention of \"co-stars\" seems perfectly consistent with Anna and Tyler being racist as well? Or maybe the point of the rebuttal is that there is at least one non-racist main character, and the claim is implicitly stating that *all * the main characters are racist?   I'm honestly not sure whether to evaluate the claim as \"all main characters are racist\" or \"some main characters are racist\" -- the interpretations seem basically equal from the perspective of someone deciding whether to watch the movie. After thinking about it: it seems a bit better to interpret it as \"some main characters are racist\" because it's hard to define exactly who counts as a main character.    The rebuttal lowers my credence in the claim simply because it seems to be conveying a message I don't understand (and if I did understand maybe it would prove the claim false).   Overall:  P(claim should be interpreted as \"all main characters are racist) = .4  P(claim is true | claim should be interpreted as \"all main characters are racist\") ~= P(Payne plays main character)*P(Payne's character is racist)*P( Anna,Tyler are only main characters other than Payne) + P(Payne DOES NOT play main character)*P(Anna, Tyler are only main characters other than Payne)=  .85*.2*.5 + .15*.5= .16 P(claim is true | claim should be interpreted as \"some main characters are racist\") = .8 (the direct evidence is weak but the rebuttal would probably be different if the reviewer didn't suggest that Anna and Tyler were racist)  P(claim is true) = .16*.4 + .8*.6 = .544",

Regarding the film being \"disturbing\", I think the evidence is only moderate: while it's true that the acts described in the supporting quotes may be deemed disturbing by most people, the fact that the quotes are merely descriptive makes it impossible to judge whether the author thought these scenes were disturbing or not - to play devil's advocate, maybe they found them hilarious.

The direct evidence also doesn't provide strong evidence that it's a \"mashup of different genres\" (only one genre is explicitly mentioned). OTOH, the rebuttal does provide more evidence that the reviewer feels the movie is surrealistic. The description of the \"reality\" seems chosen by the reviewer to convey a sense that the movie is surrealistic, whereas the direct evidence seems more like a neutral description of the movie. The rebuttal doesn't give mcuh evidence for surrealistic mashup, but I still don't understand why the rebuttal is intended to rebut the claim? Taken together, the quotes would leave me at ~65% credence in the claim, but the fact that one of the quotes is intended as a rebuttall lowers my credencecloser to 50% because it makes it much more likely that I'm confused/missed something important.

However, \"The twist here...\" does imply it to some extent, and makes it more likely that the claim is true in the context of the entire review.  The rebuttal is weak evidence against the claim. If \"much of the overt action belongs to Shahrukh Khan\", it makes it slightly less likely that Rahul is an important character, and Khan reliably delivering \"Movie Star Moment[s]\" is weak evidence against the film subverting traditional gender roles.

The rebuttal doesn't seem very strong. In particular, the inclusion of \"overt\" in the first quote suggests that the reviewer may be setting up a contrast with a different character who is important in other ways. The direct quotes don't say anything about an \"expert viewer\" in particular, but that part is reasonably likely to be true if the rest of the claim is well-supported. ",

So maybe something dodgy is going on that has prevented the movie from coming to the US in a very long time, but the evidence isn't great. Regarding 2. there is simply no evidence anywhere. A movie about the Holocaust may be deemed dark, tragic or \"about a sensitive topic\", but it's not \"controversial\" unless it takes some unusual political stance, and this does not seem to be the case.

If the movie is first shown at the Wilmette Theatre but later shown at other theaters, is it \"only opening in a single US theater\" or not?  For the purposes of this workspace, I will assume that the answer is \"it is not\" in order to avoid confusion. In particular \"the movie only opened in a single US theater\" makes it sound to me as if the movie is very unpopular, rather than that the movie was shown in one particular theater first then later being played in other theaters.   Given this assumption, the supporting quote seems like very weak evidence for the claim. The supporting quote is totally consistent with the movie eventually being shown at more than one theater, and indeed its popularity in New Zealand is evidence that the movie may be popular in the US as well. The rebuttal is further evidence that the claim is false, because it explicitly says that the movie may \"play for 80 weeks\". Overall, the claim may end up being true, but it may also end up being false, depending on the definition of \"opening\" and things that happen after the review was written. I have no idea how to assign a credence in this situation, but I do think the claim is more likely to be false than true. ",

Based on the phrasing of the quote, it seems unlikely that \"The Twelve Chairs\" is the main subject of the review, whereas it is unclear if \"Seventh Son\" is the main subject of the review or not.

The rebuttal quotes show that \"Seventh Son\" is mentioned in multiple places in the review, but the direct evidence shows that some other movie(s) are also mentioned multiple times, so it's quite unclear which is the main subject of the review.   If \"Seventh Son\" is the main topic of the review, then the claim seems somewhat unlikely to be true, as most medieval fantasies are not zany comedies.

I'm not sure if that would count as \"clearly false\" though, making it somewhat less likely.   The rebuttal is evidence that the movie isn't set during apartheid. It claims that the movie is instead set during the time of the commission's hearings, presumably referring to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

The only supporting quote that mentions South Africa apparently corresponds to a general discouse about post-apartheid South African history, rather than proof that the show is set there. The fact that a main character is Afrikaaner is evidence that the show is set in South Africa, but not decisive proof (for example, the Afrikaaner could have left South Africa post-apartheid). I find it a bit confusing that there was no short quote in the review explicitly establishing where the movie was set (or at least no such quote appears in the support or rebuttal sections), but that isn't strong evidence in either direction. Overall, it's moderately more likely than not that a movie with an Afrikaaner lead is set in South Africa. The \"in the final decades of apartheid...\" quote doesn't add additional evidence that the movie is set in South Africa, since any movie with an Afrikaaner character is almost going to mention South Africa in some manner.

The second supporting quote makes it clear that an African American is involved in some capacity, but not that the lead is African American. If the reviewer really did describe Samuel L. Jackson as black, it seems like it should have been very easy to include that in the supporting quotes, which makes me think the claim isn't true. On the other hand, that seems like a pointless thing to lie about, since it would be so easily disproven, so there's a reasonable chance that the honest expert simply neglected to include the proof, or that the quote describing Jackson as black is too long to include for some reason. Overall, I'm pretty confused/uncertain, and the blank rebuttal doesn't help. ",

It also seems odd for the reviewer to describe someone they find despicable as a \"heroine\" rather than e.g. \"main character\".   The rebuttal isn't very helpful either; I guess Ann making tapes for her daughters is weak evidence that she's not despicable? If the ellipses in the direct evidence were hiding important information, I would have expected some of the hidden information to be included in the rebuttal.   Overall, I'm very unsure but it seems marginally more likely that the claim is false.

My best guess is that it's saying \"the reviewer suggests that the male lead character is portrayed as unsympathetic in order to reflect how men in society are too powerful/otherwise flawed\", but I'm highly unsure. I understand supporting claim #2, but I don't see how it's relevant to the claim.   If I understand supporting claim #1 correctly, it is weak evidence for the claim insofar as it means that the movie is discussing gender roles and the flaws that men can have. However, there are many ways for the supporting claim #1 to be true and the overall claim to be false (e.g. the male lead is unsympathetic for reasons unrelated to mistreatment of women). If the claim were true, I would expect the expert to choose stronger supporting claims.  The rebuttal is reasonably strong evidence that the claim is false conditional on the supporting claims being true. In particular, \"the film was directed by a woman...but she should have known better\" seems to imply that the movie is not sufficiently cognizant of the mistreatment of women in society. At the very least, the quote in the rebuttal is somewhat inconsistent with mistreatment of women being a major theme in the movie. \"a tedious contrivance about a messy drunk\" is also weak evidence against the claim, because it suggests that the movie is about something other than the mistreatment of women in society.   My credence in \"the claim given the supporting claims\" is only as high as it is because I'm not sure if I interpreted supporting claim #1 correctly. It's quite possible that supporting claim #1, if interpreted correctly, strongly supports the claim and defuses the force of the rebuttal. ",

It seems like the rebuttal is making the argument that the reviewer is comparing movies about alternatives in time rather than alternatives with strong female leads, but I'm not sure, and I'm also not even sure which movie is being reviewed. At the end of the day,  no evidence is provided that the reviewer mentions two different movies with strong female leads (which is a direct implication of the claim), so the claim is less likely to be true. It seems like it should have been easy to establish \"this movie has a strong female lead\" and \"the reviewer compares this movie to another movie that also has a strong female lead\" (even with the tight character limit), so the lack of evidence for this is a particularly bad sign.   If I had to guess, I'd say that the main topic of the review is \"Run Lola Run\", which is being compared to \"Sliding Doors\" and \"Groundhog Day\" because all 3 movies have divergent timelines. There is evidence that \"Sliding Doors\" has a female lead, but no evidence that \"Run Lola Run\" has a female lead, or that female leads are relevant to the comparison. This decreases my credence in the claim further. The most likely way that the claim is true is if the honest expert simply neglected to show that the movie being reviewed had a female lead (perhaps because they thought it was obvious?). This seems unlikely but still possible -- ~20% overall chance that the claim is true?",

The rebuttal seems irrelevant -- the movie making an error with the preacher character isn't completely consistent with the preacher's response to the book burnings being an important plot point. Still, it's hard to be confident that the claim is true when the supporting quotes do not directly assert that the response is an important plot point.

This suggests the film takes place in our Universe, where Star Wars is a fictional franchise. Furthermore, the rebuttal mentions a Vietnam veteran, so I'm quite convinced the characters are here on Earth. Now, do these characters have Jedi powers? The supporting claims only establish that 1. some characters have certain (not necessarily \"Jedi\") mental powers like telepathy and 2. a character is training to be a Jedi. The rebuttal claims one of these characters is an \"acidhead\" (which suggests these paranormal powers are perhaps a hallucination) and that the book the film is based on does not claim these powers are real. This does not contradict supporting claims #2 and #3, which deal only with what the characters in the film believe, but it contradicts supporting claim #1 because this one claims the reviewer themself asserts these mental powers are real. Therefore, I think the claim hinges on supporting claim #1 being true because the other two only talk about the characters' beliefs. This claim seems to be contradicted by the rebuttal, especially the second quote, but it's lacking in context so I'm very uncertain about this. Overall, I am leaning weakly towards the claim being false.",

I looked up \"Jedi powers\" using the procedure in the instructions, but didn't get any useful information about whether \"spy at a distance\" and \"kill animals using mental powers\" are typical \"Jedi powers\").   There are two parts to the claim: A. The movie has characters with Jedi powers (from the Star Wars universe) B. These characters are on Earth.  Neither of these parts are directly shown by the supporting claims. Supporting claim #1 could be evidence that A is true (depending on what \"Jedi powers\" are), but it cannot be decisive evidence for A because there are many possible non-Jedi explanations for characters having these powers. Supporting claim #2 is stronger evidence for A, but is also not decisive (for example, \"Jedi training\" could be used as a metaphor for the kind of training the character is doing, without literally meaning the character has Jedi powers). Supporting claim #3 is not evidence for any part of the root claim, as far as I can tell.   Part B of the root claim is not supported by any supporting claim; normally \"the movie would be set on Earth\" would be a reasonable assumption, but not for a movie when characters have powers from Star Wars.    The rebuttal provides reasonable evidence for part B: if the movie has a Vietnam vet character, then it's probably set on Earth (though this \"Bill Django\" could also be the author of the book the movie is based on, or related in some other way to the movie without being a character). Apart from that, I don't see how the rebuttal is relevant. It could be interpreted as evidence that people in the movie don't actually have Jedi powers (but e.g. incorrectly believe they do due to being acidheads), but this possibility is ruled out by supporting claim #1.The rebuttal is unsuccessful because it fails to show that the characters have mental powers for reasons other than being a Jedi.   Overall, the root claim is quite likely to be true given the supporting claims and lack of a credible rebuttal, but there are still ways that it could be false. In particular, it's reasonably likely on priors that the mentions of \"Jedis\" are merely an analogy (there are many non-Jedi reasons someone can have mental powers). Also, even if the characters aren't literally Jedi, it might be hard for the rebuttal to prove this with a short quote. ",

Given this, it seems quite likely that the quote \"in theory, mind power can\" in the rebuttal directly precedes \"penetrate enemy lines in spirit, not in body\" from the supporting quotes. It's also unlikely that \"shows Wilton videos of a goat and a hamster killed by brain power\" is evidence that the reviewer is asserting that people in the film can kill animals with mental powers (rather than e.g. saying that one character showed another a hoax video of killing a goat with mental powers).   The final two quotes in the rebuttal weaken the claim further by explicitly saying that a book \"doesn't claim paranormal powers are real\". It's likely but not certain that the book in question is the \"2004 book\" that the movie is based on, implying that the movie doesn't claim that the paranormal powers are real. Overall, if the movie actually had characters with paranormal powers, there should have been much stronger supporting quotes. The most likely way for the claim to be true is if the movie was based on the 2004 book, but embellished the book by claiming the paranormal powers were real (unlike the book).

I am very confident in my view of what's going on in the film, but I understand why assigning a truth value to this claim can be tricky, since the training is not real (as it would be in a real Star Wars film). Nonetheless I am going to give it a 90%, because, taken literally, the claim only says the character is training to be a Jedi - and this is true regardless of whether the training turned out to be a scam or not.",

I'm ~80% sure that this or a similar interpretation is true. My main uncertainty here is whether said interpretation would makes the claim true or false; my best guess is that it makes the claim false, because the reviewer doesn't claim that the character is literally training as a Jedi (nor is the character training as a Jedi in reality). However, it's also plausible that Cassady believed he was training to be a Jedi, and that that's sufficient to make the claim true. ",

It's unclear if there are important contextual differences between explaining a \"theory of Jedi Warriordom\" and \"explaining what Jedis are\", and it's also unclear what \"Little joke\" from the end of the rebuttal means. If the character is explaining what Jedis are as a joke, I believe that would still make the claim true. If the reviewer is joking about the character explaining Jedis, then that would make the claim false. Neither of those hypotheticals seem very likely though, so I have no idea what \"little joke\" actually means. Overall, the supporting quote seems to make it more likely than not that the claim is true, but I'm unsure about too many things to assign a high credence. ",

Supporting claim #3 provides some support for B (again, aliens are common in SF movies but this doesn't show that the movie is a SF parody). Supporting claim #4 provides some support for B, C, and D by making it more likely that the movie is a parody and/or satire (though it doesn't explicitly show that the movie satirizes *society*). Supporting claim #5 provides weak support for D, as religious cults are a feature of society that is often parodied. The main weak points in the claim are:  1) \"the movie is *parodying* SF/horror movies\" 2) \"the movie is satirizing *society*\"  The rebuttal doesn't seem relevant to the claim.

My main doubt is whether \"superficial resemblance to a human being\" is sufficient to describe the aliens as \"looking and acting\" like humans. I don't think that the difference is very important from the perspective of someone deciding whether to see the movie, nor do I think it would be important for most top-level claims. Thus, I think the claim is quite likely to be true.   \"These creatures ride bicycles to the ferry to conserve fuel\" is further weak evidence of \"acting like humans\" -- this seems like something that humans would plausibly do, but also like something aliens would plausibly do (i.e. it's not distinctively human). The rebuttal seems irrelevant to the claim. \"Nobody in this movie are real enough for us to identify with\" might be a weak argument that the aliens don't \"act like humans\", but I think that the two phrases have completely different meanings (I'm not sure if this was the intended point of the rebuttal quote or not).

However, if the review explicitly argues that the film is artistically ambitious, then I would expect the strongest evidence for \"artistically ambitious\" to be more compelling. OTOH, \"the ending is artistically ambitious\" is the sort of claim that can be clearly true after reading te entire review, but difficult to support with short snippets of text. Overall, the direct evidence for part A is slightly weaker than I would have expected if it were true.   The direct evidence for part B is pretty strong, particularly the first part of the quote. I'm pretty convinced that the ending did not work well, but not that it was artistically ambitious (maybe it was just irrational and poorly thought out?)  The rebuttal seems like weak evidence that the ending is not artistically ambitious: thrillers are less likely to be artistically ambitious, and the ending is apparently a \"Shocking Climax\" that has \"ground up\" the intelligence displayed earlier. This makes the movie ending sound trite rather than ambitious, but doesn't definitively disprove the claim. ",

However, the statement in such a short quote could be reversed in the following sentence, especially given the way it's phrased (\"we must\").

After looking up the definition of a \"drama movie\" per instructions, I think that claim #3 is evidence that the movie is a drama (but I'm very uncertain because I don't know anything about movies!).   I don't understand how the rebuttal is relevant to either part of the claim (\"conventional\" or \"drama\"). It could be intended as evidence that C C is not conventional, but that doesn't say much about whether the movie is conventional overall.   Overall, I'm highly unsure if the claim is true or not given the supporting claims.  My main hesitation is that none of the supporting claims explicitly support either of the two parts of the root claim. I would expect malicious experts to try a strategy like \"prove that the movie has conventional and drama-like features, then claim that *the reviewer suggests* that the movie is a conventional drama\", making it more likely that this is a false claim.

Including such an ambiguous quote would normally be a warning sign, but for something like \"one of the main characters is conventional\" I can see the quote in question being the strongest evidence, even if the claim is true.    I don't understand what's going on with the rebuttal, as it seems to provide additional support for the claim that the movie is cliched.

The movie could be a grim and depressing crime movie and still contain occasional funny parts, in which case the claim \"the film is a comic crime movie\" would not be true from the perspective of someone deciding whether to watch the film.   The rebuttal attempts to show that the film is not comic, by giving quotes that describe various un-funny features of the film. Overall, neither the supporting claims nor the rebuttal decisively prove that the film is/is not a \"comic crime movie\". However, the burden of proof is on the supporting claims: if the movie is comic the reviewer should explicitly state that, but if the movie is not then the reviewer won't necessarily state \"the movie is not comic\". \"There are funny parts of the film\" is evidence that it is a comic crime movie, but not strong enough to overcome the burden of proof, so the claim is slightly more likely to be false than true.

The phrasing of the sentence weakly suggests they were not subtle, and reading the first page of google results about \"Scenes from a Marriage\" also weakly suggests it wasn't subtle. However, it's unclear to me why this would have been picked as a supporting quote if Ingmar Bergman were known as an unsubtle director. Since I know much less about movies or directors compared to the intended audience of the review (or the Ought judging pool, probably), this makes me wonder if I misinterpreted the evidence (and Scenes from a Marriage is indeed known as a subtle film). The rebuttal doesn't say anything about whether themovie is subtle, but it does provide weak evidence that it's not (by suggesting the director specializes in exploitation movies, which are not generally subtle AFAIK).

The rebuttal appears to be mostly irrelevant, but it may be weak evidence against the claim by suggesting that the workers' revolt was unrelated to the widow.   The main problem with the claim is the lack of support for part D; I think this is slightly more likely to be malicious than to be an honest oversight, but I'm very uncertain. If I learned that the 3 supporting claims were true of a random review (and weren't adversarially selected), I would be fairly confident that part D is true, so my credence largely depends on my beliefs about the meta-game.

If so, the claim could easily be false. For example, it seems plausible that the review is saying \"Western audiences would be more interested in the melodrama *of* the workers' resistance than in [some other theme of the movie, like the parable of China's development].

Supporting claim #2 is strong evidence that the film is related to cricket, which is moderate support for part C. Supporting claim #3 is strong evidence for parts B and C when combined with #2: #3 shows that playing cricket brings the town closer together, and #2 provides moderately strong evidence that this is a major theme in the film (because the main character is the one who starts the interest in cricket).   Given the supporting claims, the most likely way for the claim to be false is if the film isn't about a fading town itself, but merely compared to a different film about a fading town in the review. It's also possible (but somewhat unlikely) that \"the townspeople are brought together by playing cricket\" is true but tangential to the main plot. If so, I'd interpret the claim as false from the perspective of someone deciding whether to watch the movie.   The rebuttal makes it somewhat more likely that \"the town is brought closer together by playing cricket\" is not a central part of the plot, as the cricket-playing is apparently part of a complex scheme involving mass role-playing. However, the rebuttal quote and supporting claims #2 and #3 could be referring to different things: supporting claim #2 suggests that the town is genuinely interested in cricket, not faking it, and I don't see how faking interest in cricket would bring the town closer together (per claim #3). Thus, it's perfectly possible that the cricket playing becomes an important part of the plot for reasons unrelated to the complex scheme. Overall, the rebuttal weakly reduces my credence in the claim: if nothing else, the claim completely ignoring the \"complex scheme\" in the rebuttal makes it less likely that the claim is a clearly true statement of what the film is about.  My main uncertainty is how the lack of support for \"fading town\" affects the likelihood that the claim is true. I suspect the answer is \"not much\", because an honest expert could easily neglect to include a subclaim explicitly supporting \"fading town\", whereas a malicious expert could simply omit \"fading town\" from the claim if they were unable to support it. This logic wouldn't hold if \"fading town\" were the only false part of the claim, but then I doubt the claim would qualify as \"clearly false\" as stipulated in the instructions. ",

The excellent Canadian actor and filmmaker...\"  If \"The Grand Seduction\" is the film in question, then the claim seems pretty likely to be true, and I'm not sure why the quote provided in the rebuttal is evidence against it. The reviewer is clearly comparing \"The Grand Seduction\" to \"Seducing Doctor Lewis\". As the review states that \"The Grand Seduction\" is based on \"Seducing Doctor Lewis\", the latter must also be about \"a Newfoundland fishing town mounting a wild scheme to draw a petroleum factory\". Thus, both films are clearly about a brought together by a common cause, and I think it's reasonable to infer that a town embarking on \"a wild scheme to draw a petroleum factory\" is a fading town. I spent a few minutes trying to think of ways the rebuttal quote is evidence against the claim, but I can't think of any. The possibility that I'm missing something important reduces my credence somewhat. It could be argued that saying \"film X is a remake of film Y\" isn't \"comparing\" the two films, but that seems like a fairly pedantic and unlikely interpretation. ",

If the ellipses don't leave out important context: The direct evidence strongly supports part B. This is fairly strong evidence for part C as well, because the reviewer is somewhat unlikely to mention their opinions about horror movies unless they are in fact reviewing a horror movie. The only evidence presented for part A is: 1) \"multi-tentacled argument\" (evidence for \"varied\" but not for \"incoherent) 2) \"Lee has trouble controlling it\" (weak evidence since it's not stated who Lee is or what it is) 3) the fact that the reviewer is mentioning that it's OK for horror movies to be \"imprecise\" and not \"making a case\" is evidence that this movie in particular has those qualities.   Overall, this evidence is slightly weaker than I would expect to see if part A were true. (and again, all the discussion above is conditional on the ellipses not leaving anything out)   The rebuttal seems to focus on proving that the movie's incoherence is not \"okay\". This is implicit evidence for part A, which I had considered the weakest part of the claim. The rebuttal is consistent with the claim -- the reviewer could say that \"this will prove either maddening ... or exhilarating\" or similar. \tThe rebuttal  provides weak evidence that the ellipses in the direct evidence are being used to conceal important context, but I find it relatively plausible that the claim advanced by the direct evidence is what the author intended to say.   Overall, I would say that the claim is somewhat likely to be true, especially because the rebuttal concedes the weakest part of the claim. ",

Taken together, #1 and #2 suggest the claim is true but do not directly imply it -- the reviewer could believe that the inability to empathize with the characters is a flaw, but is unrelated to an emphasis on ideas. For example, maybe the characters are just unlikeable; #3 makes this interpretation somewhat less likely by suggesting a potential link between the movie emphasizing an idea (that movies are fictional), and being unable to empathize with the characters. However, when considering that these claims were optimized to maximize support for the root claim, I find it odd that no claim directly links \"centered on ideas\" and \"difficult to empathize with characters\". The rebuttal isn't a knock down argument, but it's difficult to prove that the text doesn't say something. The fact that the overall review is so positive about the movie suggests that the reviewer sees subclaim #2 as a relatively minor problem, which is slightly less likely if it's related to the central conceit of the film",

A) featuring political activists B) those political activists are high schoolers C) their political activism stems from issues with their parents   The direct evidence is not very compelling overall, because it's not very clear whether the quotes refer to the movie being reviewed or not. If the quotes do refer to the movie, then: \"message by falling back on conservative clichés about activism\" is strong evidence for A \"the idea that activists are all just rich kids angry at their parents\" is strong evidence for C and weak evidence for B (if the activists are kids then they're more likely to be HS students, though \"rich kids\" can be used to refer to young rich people in general) \"a movie about slumming brats\" is weak evidence for B for similar reasons.   The rebuttal seems to be strong evidence against B: if \"Doc\" is a Stanford-trained former aid worker, they probably aren't a high school student. Also, the quotes \"former aid worker who suffers from Parkinson's-like symptoms\" and \"team medic\" don't match the image portrayed by \"slumming brats\" and \"rich kids angry at their parents\", making it much more likely that the direct evidence was taken out of context. I don't understand how the last two rebuttal quotes are relevant.   Overall, the truth of the claim depends strongly on whether the direct evidence quotes are actually about the movie being reviewed. My best guess is that they are not (due to the phrasing + the rebuttal quotes), so the claim is somewhat unlikely to be true.   P(direct evidence quotes are about the reviewed movie) = .2 P(claim is true|direct evidence quotes are about the reviewed movie) = .85 P(claim is true | direct evidence quotes are NOT about the reviewed movie) = .1  P(claim is true) = .2*.85 + .8*.1 = .25",

Only supporting claim #1 seems relevant to evaluating the root claim; in particular, I don't understand why #2 and #3 mention \"Liam and Noel\", who don't show up in the root claim. Claim #1 confirms that the film is a documentary about a band, but doesn't mention whether the band is a rock band. Also, \"doesn't suggest the film is unconventional\" is not good evidence for \"suggests the fillm is conventional\": if the reviewer never comments on whether the film is conventional, then the root claim would be false IMHO. Overall, I don't see any good reason to think the claim is true; the only reason my credence isn't lower is the possibility that subclaims #2-#4 somehow provide support for the main claim for a reason that I don't understand. The rebuttal isn't very relevant, which makes it somewhat more likely that Oasis is a rock band. If Oasis were a different kind of band, it should have been easy to find a quote showing that. However, if the review never takes a stand on whether the film is conventional, then the claim would be false, but there would be no quote in the review that directly rebuts the claim. ",

However, the claim also says that \"the reviewer doesn't suggest that the film is unconventional\", which establishes a universal quantifier: the claim can only be true if no sentence suggests that the film is unconventional. Therefore, the strength of the rebuttal is much more important for establishing the truth of the claim. In particular, the root claim is more likely to be true than not if quote in the rebuttal is less strong than you would expect if the reviewer did in fact think the film was unconventional.   The rebuttal provides very weak evidence that the reviewer suggests that the film is unconventional (i.e. by implying a more conventional film would have gotten farther in the overall history of the band). Even though the quote is quite weak, it's also very possible that the review overall suggests that the film is unconventional, without any short quote decisively showing that. Overall, the weakness of the strongest quote showing that the film is unconventional is moderate but not decisive evidence that the claim is true. ",

The rebuttal isn't relevant AFAICT: it might be weak evidence against the supporting claims, but it's not evidence that the root claim is false given that the supporting claims are true. My main uncertainty is whether the reviewer has to literally use the word \"offensive\" for the root claim to be true, or whether the claim is true as long as the reviewer makes it clear that they believe the film to have content that would make it offensive to any reasonable viewer.

However: 1) the phrase \"men's roles\" is not totally clear, and could refer to something other than the platonic relationship depending on how the supporting claims were evaluated, 2) the combination of #2 and #3 is a very circuitous way to say that the relationship is analogous to a romance. The extremely narrow nature of each claim makes me suspicious that they do not add up to the reviewer suggesting the relationship is analogous to a romance in context. However, it's somewhat hard to imagine what context would falsify the claim given #2 and #3, so I still assign a 65% credence. The rebuttal doesn't seem very relevant, but if the reviewer just never compares the relationship to a romance, it would be difficult to prove it. I guess the rebuttal makes the relationship seem less romantic by implying that there are ignoble motivations (if the rebuttal quote is talking aotu the same platonic relationship as the claim). ",

This is possible but unlikely -- the quote proves that that author mentions strippers, and I can't think of anything else that could be described as \"erotic only to men who enjoy seeing women humiliate themselves\" that would plausibly be in a movie review.   The rebuttal doesn't seem very relevant -- it would need to prove that \"they\" refers to something else, or that the quote somehow isn't from the reviewer (e.g. because it's a quote from a character in a movie).

I'm still not sure if this is a reasonable assumption or not, though it doesn't affect my credence substantially in this case).  Actually, I believe that I'm allowed to look up whether Zappa was a musician -- it's likely that this is context that other participants would know.

Part B is strongly supported, conditional on the ellipses not leaving out important context. However, I'm somewhat suspicious, because I expect claiming \"X did Y\" when in reality Z did Y seems like it would be a common malicious expert strategy. Furthermore, the phrasing of the supporting quotes is a bit odd, if Prince really was the person testifying. Also, looking up \"Prince\" per instructions reveals that he is a musician, and I wouldn't expect a musician to be testifying at a hearing (though I don't know what a PMRC hearing is).   The rebuttal is fairly strong evidence that Prince was not the person testifying at the PMRC hearings. The rebuttal establishes that the subject of the review is probably a documentary on Frank Zappa; this means that the body of the supporting quote is probably referring to Zappa rather than Prince. It's somewhat odd that the rebuttal doesn't include the full context around \"Prince...\" if Prince is not the person testifying in the PMRC hearings, but the claim is still likely to be false. ",

However, I'm assuming that that wouldn't be enough to make the claim 'clearly false', so the claim must either be true or contain bigger falsehoods.   There is very little evidence that the film is in a contemporary setting: the only evidence I can see is that growth as a writer appears to be central to the protagonist's identity, which is marginally more likely in a contemporary film than a film in another setting (where said setting might be more important). I would expect the text to contain much stronger evidence if the claim were true, but it's possible that this is simply an oversight from the honest expert, or there wasn't any quote concise enough to be included without running afoul of the character limit.   The rebuttal is quite weak, and I'm not sure I understand why it is relevant. My best guess is that it tries to show that the film is not a coming-of-age drama  by implying that Jo (the character) is a mother, rather than someone coming of age. However, it seems much more likely that the reviewer is just mentioning their own mother for some reason, and that the Jo in the film is not \"my own mother\". The lack of evidence against \"contemporary setting\" in the rebuttal raises my credence that the claim is true.   Overall, the direct evidence doesn't decisively prove the claim, but the rebuttal is weak enough that the claim seems quite likely to be true (assuming expert play is at a decent level) ",

However, the direct evidence doesn't provide any evidence that Angy is a main character (though this is relatively likely as Angy is mentioned multiple times in the review).   If I interpret the blank rebuttal as the claim \"there is no evidence in the text which contradicts the claim\", then I'm very confident that the claim is true. If Angy were a peripheral character, then the rebuttal should have included evidence to that effect. If I just ignore the blank rebuttal, then I'm highly uncertain whether the claim is true or not.

There's also no evidence in the direct quote that the movie is \"overly romantic\", or that \"photographing this society\" is related to the movie. However, it's possible that the reviewers feel that the movie was biased towards the idea that children are better on the street, even if that's never explicitly argued for.  ",

Supporting claims #2 and #3 don't seem to add much  given #1 and #4, but they provide additional circumstantial evidence that the movie is political and might be banned in China.    The only part of the rebuttal that seems relevant to the root claim is \"who stands apart from all the political currents\". This could be interpreted as evidence that the movie is not a political statement; however, the quote is ambigouous, and that interpretation is directly contradicted by supporting claim #1.   Overall, the claim seems highly likely to be true.

The first supporting quote is evidence that characters in the movie struggle under communism, but not that reviewer or the movie are *criticising* communism. The second supporting quote is clearly a criticism of some sort of society/political system, but it doesn't show that the movie is criticizing Chinese Communism in particular. For example, the quote could be about the regime that preceded the \"new communist\" regime mentioned in the first supporting quote.  The quotes given in rebuttal is weak evidence against the claim, particularly the \"stands apart from all the political currents\". This suggests that the reviewer is not emphasizing the movie's criticism of any political system, presumably including Chinese Communism. However, the rebuttal is much weaker than I would expect if the claim were false (so it actually raises my credence in the claim somewhat). In particular, it appears that the 2nd supporting quote is indeed about Chinese Commuism (or the rebuttal should have shown otherwise), making the claim more likely.   Overall, the claim seems more likely than not to be true, but it's somewhat strange that the supporting quotes aren't more explicit, given that the reviewer supposedly \"emphasizes\" the movie's criticism of Communism.

Overall, it's unclear if the claim would be described as true by a reasonable reader with full context; for example, I think it would be fair to describe some of the HK protestors as \"fresh-faced would-be high school revolutionaries\" as well as \"young revolutionaries\".

This technically doesn't prove that there are fights in exotic locations (plural), but I doubt the difference is significant for the tree overall, or from the perspective of someone deciding whether to see the movie. Overall, part A is strongly supported.   The supporting quotes also establish that the hero is the son of a billionaire, and that someone called Largo Winch is struggling for control of an eponymous corporation; taken together, this is very strong evidence for part B.   The rebuttal quote \"I began to fear the movie would play out right there in the boardroom\" appears to be an argument against \"fights in exotic locations\". However, it's very weak evidence: \"I began to fear that the movie woudl take place in the boardroom\" doesn't mean that it actually did, and the supporting quote proves otherwise. ",

This distinction is somewhat important because \"lists the cliches\" implies that the reviewer is singling them out for criticism, rather than neutrally describing a plot which happens to contain things that readers would recognize as cliches. \"Cliche\" is only used once in the supporting quotes: \"movie cliche he called \"The Climbing Killer\". The use of \"he\" in the quote suggests that the reviewer theirself doesn't describe the movie as cliched, in which case the claim would be misleading.   The rebuttal is irrelevant (in fact, it's the same rebuttal as all the other workspaces I've seen so far in this tree....). This slightly raises my credence in the claim because it means that the ellipses in the supporting quotes probably don't leave out important context that would falsify the claim. Overall, the claim seems more likely to be true than not, but the ambiguity in the supporting quotes somewhat reduces my confidence. My specific credence of 65% relies on vague priors about how likely the reviewer is to describe a movie as cliched given that it has the various features listed in the supporting quotes. ",

                        "explanation": "Every claim in the review is directly supported by a subclaim, except for \"stands out due to\". The rebuttal appears fairly irrelevant to evaluating the truth of the root claim given the subclaims, as it doesn't seem to touch on anything mentioned in either the root claim or the subclaims. The rebuttal is possibly relevant to \"authentic setting\", but this part of the claim is directly supported by subclaim #2.   I had a bit of trouble coming up with a good credence for this review. If I was told that claims #2-#5 were true of a randomly selected review, I would assign a high credence to the claim \"the reviewer says that the movie stands out due to <claims #2-#5>\". The claims #2-#5 all describe the movie in positive terms, making it quite likely that the movie \"stands out\". However, taking into account the way in which the claim and subclaims were selected makes it more difficult.   P(no subclaim states \"movie stands out due to...\" | claim is true) = 30% -- it seems somewhat unlikely (but not totally implausible) that this could have been overlooked by an honest expert. P(no subclaim states \"movie stands out due to...\" | claim is false) = 50% -- this credence is incredibly speculative, and it could change substantially upon reflection. However, it seems that if the claim is false, then the supporting claims provided would leave out the subclaim that is hardest to prove. Thus, P(no subclaim states \"movie stands out due to...\" | claim is false) should equal P(\"movie stands out due to...\" is the hardest subclaim to prove | claim is false). This seems moderately likely, since it's possible to twist isolated statements to provide support for the other subclaims, but difficult to give support for \"movie stands out\" if the reviewer doesn't think the movie stood out. However, this depends substantially on the content of the review, so it's hard to assign a high credence (especially as an uninformative prior would only assign a probability of 1/6 ). (Note that I'm using the event \"claim is true\" or \"claim is false\" to refer to the specific claim given being true or false, rather than the event \"a generic claim made about this review is true/false\". )  Overall, given a prior of 50% that the claim is true, this implies a posterior of (.5*.3)/(.5*.3 + .5*.5) = .375. This is somewhat lower than the credence I was inclined to assign before explicitly reasoning about the probabilities, so I'm rounding up to 40%. Now that I think about, it does make sense that the credence should be less than 50%, assuming the honest experts are reasonably competent -- it's quite suspicious that an important subclaim was left out.

The rebuttal is mostly irrelevant -- the fact that there is a scene set in Vermont is not evidence that the film is an inauthentic representation of New York. My best guess is that a reasonable reader would conclude that \"the reviewer says the film is an authentic representation of New York\" after reading the entire review, given that the setting is \"one of the most important factors\" and the lack of contradictory evidence, but the evidence is totally consistent with the claim being false.
